I have recently completed a Master of Advanced Study (Part III) in Applied Mathematics at The University of Cambridge.

I am now looking to continue my studies with a PhD in quantum computing. I am particularly interested in quantum error correction and fault tolerance.

Please [contact me](mailto:Miles.D.Gorman@gmail.com) if you would like my detailed CV.
